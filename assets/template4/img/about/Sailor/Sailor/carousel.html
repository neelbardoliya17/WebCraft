          Since applying the Coppercoat system I have been delighted with its performance. There's been much less weed build-up than in previous years, and what did appear has been easy to remove. Itâ€™s quite a high initial outlay, but a lot of money will be saved over the years and it seems to work as a very effective anti-fouling with the bonus of offering good hull protection.
